# Quiz-Game
This a quiz game using oops in python.  
This project was created by me during Udmey course.
The project has 4 parts first is the main.py, question_model, question_brain, data
the question model class has a question framework on which the question is framed
In the question_brain class the user input is taken and checks it to the correct answer and evaluates it.
In the data module the questions are appended into a list in which each question is a dictionary where the key is text and answer and using the question and key is accessed.
